# Deep Audio Classifier
* Detection of Capuchin bird calls from the recordings of the forests.
* Dataset - https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/kenjee/z-by-hp-unlocked-challenge-3-signal-processing

**Algorithm description**:-

*   We are having a dataset of various audio clips containing Capuchin birds and Not Capuchin birds and some real life audio clips of forests.We need to train a model to detect the Capuchin audio perfectly from the forest audio files accurately.



**The steps we follow are** :-



*   Convert audio data to waveforms
*   Transform waveform to spectrogram
*   Classify Capuchin bird calls
